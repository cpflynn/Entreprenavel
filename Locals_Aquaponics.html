        <h2>Locals Aquaponics</h2>
        <p>Frigid winds whisked sheets of snow through the blustery New York night. Feet of snow piling upon her doorstep, Nadia Robinson tended to the carousel propagation chambers. In her indoor grow house, plants and fish thrived in a symbiotic relationship, typically reserved for wetland ecosystems. Testing the waters of aquaponics, Nadia found her entrepreneurial niche during her final year at Syracuse University. This was the future of the community food movement, the front-line defense to fight food insecurity. This was Locals.<p>
        <p>Almost three years later, Locals is based out of Washington, DC, leading the Capitol Community’s charge to reclaim its food supply. Comprised of partners and programs, the Locals network functions as a collaborative ecosystem. The business works with community organizations, local distributors, and partner agencies to offer fresh organic produce to health-conscious consumers.</p>
        <p>In addition to providing produce, Locals is partnering with the Kaizen Life Skills Foundation and Martha’s Table to educate community members on indoor agriculture methods. The Locals SEED program focuses on workforce development for disadvantaged individuals, and the GroLab program supports youth through S.T.E.M. education. Another program, VETGRO, trains US Military for management careers at Locals. This integral inclusion of community assets embodies conscious capitalism.</p>
        <p>Consumer outreach stands alongside partnerships and programs as one of Locals’ strongest assets. Locals desires to gain an in-depth understanding of customer needs. The team also plans to build ongoing sales relationships, where clients come first. Currently, Locals is making the push for founding customers, the back-bone of Locals’ engagement strategy.</p>
        <p>Founding customers will receive fresh baskets of spring lettuce, greens, and herbs. Additionally, they will gain access to exclusive Locals events, such as farm dinners and agricultural education sessions.  Spots are running out!

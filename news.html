        <p>Are you insecure about how other people view you? Join the club. Whether we like it or not, we are all status-seekers in some ways. We worry about our job titles, our companies’ reputations, and our salaries. Sometimes we fret over the clothes we wear, the size of our living spaces, and the cars we drive. Striving to be viewed in a positive light, we work tirelessly to elevate our social standing by acquiring symbols of status. <p>

        <p>Pay for Success (PFS) is an innovative new funding mechanism that is used to finance social-benefit projects with high-quality impact metrics. PFS projects are popping up in every sector from homelessness, to healthcare, to education. New models prove that PFS projects can be used to stimulate investment in commodities, as well as workforce development. What impact will this have on the private sector? Will your business Pay for Success?</p>
        <p>Peruvian Commodities:<p>
        <p>The Common Fund for Commodities unveiled a Development Impact Bond (DIB) to modernize cocoa and coffee production in Peru’s Amazon region, the Ashaninka. This first standing commodity-sector DIB breaks into a new frontier of Pay for Success (PFS) possibility.</p>

        <p>Frigid winds whisked sheets of snow through the blustery New York night. Feet of snow piling upon her doorstep, Nadia Robinson tended to the carousel propagation chambers. In her indoor grow house, plants and fish thrived in a symbiotic relationship, typically reserved for wetland ecosystems. Testing the waters of aquaponics, Nadia found her entrepreneurial niche during her final year at Syracuse University. This was the future of the community food movement, the front-line defense to fight food insecurity. This was Locals.<p>
        <p>Almost three years later, Locals is based out of Washington, DC, leading the Capitol Community’s charge to reclaim its food supply. Comprised of partners and programs, the Locals network functions as a collaborative ecosystem. The business works with community organizations, local distributors, and partner agencies to offer fresh organic produce to health-conscious consumers.</p>
